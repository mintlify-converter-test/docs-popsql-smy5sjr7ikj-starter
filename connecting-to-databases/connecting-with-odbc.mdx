Note: PopSQL supports ODBC only as a direct connection.

ODBC allows you to connect to any database that supports the ODBC standard.

Connecting with ODBC involves four steps, which we'll go through in detail below.

1.  Download a connector for the database you're trying to connect to.
2.  If you're on macOS or Linux, you'll need `unixodbc`.
3.  Configure ODBC.
4.  Tell PopSQL which ODBC connection to use

## Step 1: Download a connector

*   [Impala](https://www.cloudera.com/downloads/connectors/impala/odbc/2-5-41.html)
    
*   [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/mariadb-connector-odbc)
    
*   [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/solutions/solution-areas/business-analytics/odbc-driver.html)
    
*   [Databricks](https://docs.databricks.com/integrations/bi/jdbc-odbc-bi.html)
    

## Step 2: Get unixodbc

### macOS

Note, if you are using a M1 mac, you will need to install a `x86_64` compatible unixodbc. See [this post](https://medium.com/mkdir-awesome/how-to-install-x86-64-homebrew-packages-on-apple-m1-macbook-54ba295230f)
 for how to setup a `x86_64` compatible homebrew and you would then use that when installing unixodbc.

```bash
# If you use Homebrew (more common):
brew install unixodbc

# If you use MacPorts:
sudo port unixodbc

```

### Linux

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install unixodbc

```

### Windows

If you're a Windows user, nothing to do here, go to the next step.

## Step 3: Configure ODBC

For Windows users, visit [this article](https://www.stata.com/support/faqs/data-management/configuring-odbc-win/)
.

### Locate the configuration files

Now we can locate the ODBC configuration files with the following command `odbcinst -j`:

```bash
$ odbcinst -j
unixODBC 2.3.5
DRIVERS............: /usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini
SYSTEM DATA SOURCES: /usr/local/etc/odbc.ini
FILE DATA SOURCES..: /usr/local/etc/ODBCDataSources
USER DATA SOURCES..: /Users/popsql/.odbc.ini
SQLULEN Size.......: 8
SQLLEN Size........: 8
SQLSETPOSIROW Size.: 8

```

`/usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini` is a configuration file to define the ODBC drivers available.

`/usr/local/etc/odbc.ini` is a configuration file to define the ODBC data source name (DSN) available.

### Declare a new driver

Let's open `/usr/local/etc/odbcinst.ini` and add the following section:

```text
[MyODBC Driver]
Description = MyODBC Driver
Driver      = /usr/local/lib/libmyodbcdriver.dylib

```

The most important line is the `Driver` one. You will need to specify the driver library previously installed. On `macOS`, libraries are ending with `.dylib` and on linux with `.so`.

### Declare a new data source name (DSN)

Let's open `/usr/local/etc/odbc.ini` and add the following section:

```text
[MyODBC Connection]
Driver      = MyODBC Driver
ServerName  = localhost
Port        = 9999
Database    = test
Username    = popsql

```

The most important line is the `Driver` one. You will need to specify the driver name we specified in the previous step.

All other attributes as `ServerName`, `Port`, `Database`, `Username` are optional and depends on the connector. I implemented them in my custom libraries but your connector might use another name or allows for even more attributes such as configuring ssl for example. Please refer to their documentation.

You can also specify those attributes later on in the connection string.

### Verify your config is good

To make sure our configuration worked, we can use a tool called `isql`

`isql` syntax is: `isql DSN [UID [PWD]] [options]`

If you did not specify any username or password in the previous step you can specify them here.

If everything is working as expected the command output should look like:

```bash
$ isql -v "MyODBC Connection"
+---------------------------------------+
| Connected!                            |
|                                       |
| sql-statement                         |
| help [tablename]                      |
| quit                                  |
|                                       |
+---------------------------------------+

```

### Step 4: Tell PopSQL which ODBC connection to use

Now you can tell PopSQL which connection to use based on what you wrote in `odbc.ini`.
