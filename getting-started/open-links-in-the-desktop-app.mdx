You can access your PopSQL files via their unique URL. These can be used to open the file in the browser, or in the PopSQL desktop app.

## When you open a file link

When you click on a PopSQL link, PopSQL will open the link in the browser by default.

When you open your first file, you'll see an alert when the file opens. PopSQL will ask you: **Do you want to open this file in the desktop app?**

*   To continue to view the file in the browser, click **No, thanks**.
*   If you'd like to open the PopSQL file link in the desktop app, click **Open in app**.

To remember your choice for future links, check the box next to **Remember choice** and select either option. This will store your choice in your preferences, so you won't see the notification again.

If you click **Open in app**, PopSQL will open the desktop app and load the file. You will still be able to view the file in the browser, click **open this link in the browser**.

## Update your link preferences

If you want to open all PopSQL URLs in the desktop app, you can enable the **Open links in desktop app when possible** setting. You can find this in your Preferences.

*   Click on your personal icon in the top bottom corner
*   Select **Preferences** in the menu
*   Select the checkbox for **Open links in desktop app when possible**

A check mark will be displayed next to the setting to show it is enabled. If there is a check next to the the setting already, you can select the setting again to disable it.
