PopSQL checks for updates automatically, and it'll tell you when a new update ready.

If you're curious what version you're running, or you'd like to manually check for updates, visit `Preferences > Updates`.

There, you can also subscribe to beta updates to try out new features before everyone else. When you're on a beta release, you can always downgrade to the latest stable release.
